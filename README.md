##TeaTimer

After finishing a Udemy React course I decided to make a hobby app in order to practice my ReactJS skills.

I ported my webpack setup over to create-react-app, started implementing styles on the guideliness from google material design and playing with the controls for the countdown clock from the code follow-along (see ReactTimer for reference).

The code is inspired in part by the course, but is more an adaptation of principles and guidelines I learned. It is written entirely by me, and can be forker or reused freely.

Thanks for stopping by.
